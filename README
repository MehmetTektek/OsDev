# OsDev Project

## 📖 Description
A brief description of your operating system project. What are you trying to build? Is it for learning purposes, a hobby, or something more specific? What are the main goals or philosophy behind it?

*(Example: This is a hobby operating system being developed from scratch for learning purposes. The initial goal is to create a minimal 32-bit kernel capable of booting, handling basic interrupts, and displaying text on the screen.)*

## 🌟 Current Status
What is the current state of the project? What milestones have you reached?

*(Example: Currently, the OS can boot into a protected mode, has a basic GDT and IDT setup, and can handle keyboard interrupts to display typed characters.)*

## ✨ Features
List the features that are currently implemented or planned for the near future.

### Implemented
* Feature 1 (e.g., Bootloader)
* Feature 2 (e.g., Protected Mode Switching)
* Feature 3 (e.g., Basic Interrupt Handling)
* Feature 4 (e.g., PS/2 Keyboard Driver)
* Feature 5 (e.g., VGA Text Mode Output)

### Planned
* Feature A (e.g., Simple Memory Management - Paging)
* Feature B (e.g., Basic Filesystem)
* Feature C (e.g., User Mode)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
What languages, assemblers, and tools are you using?
* **Language(s):** (e.g., C, Assembly (NASM/YASM))
* **Build System:** (e.g., Make, GRUB, custom scripts)
* **Emulator/Testing:** (e.g., QEMU, Bochs, VirtualBox)
* **Debugger:** (e.g., GDB)
* **Target Architecture:** (e.g., x86, x86_64)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
What does someone need to have installed to build and run your OS?
* (e.g., `make`)
* (e.g., `gcc` or a specific cross-compiler like `i686-elf-gcc`)
* (e.g., `nasm` or `yasm`)
* (e.g., `qemu`)
* (e.g., `grub-mkrescue` or similar for creating bootable images)
